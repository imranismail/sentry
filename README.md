# Sentry

"Sentry provides a set of helpers and conventions that will guide you in leveraging Elixir modules to build a simple, robust authorization system." - Inspired by [elabs/pundit](https://github.com/elabs/pundit)

**This code is still a proof of concept** as it is. I am making sure that once it nears 1.0 I'll make sure things are in order and stabilized
